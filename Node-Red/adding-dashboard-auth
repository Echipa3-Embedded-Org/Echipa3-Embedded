Node-RED Dashboard security allows for basic authentication when accessing the UI.

Setup:

Edit the file: ~/.node-red/settings.js

Find the commented line starting with: httpNodeAuth

Uncomment and modify the password hash

To generate a hash for any cleartext password, node-red has a built in command: node-red admin hash-pw

This command does the following:
  - waits for user input (the password written in clear-text)
  - generates a hash in console for the input


After the file was modified, restart the service with: node-red-restart

Notes:
  - The browser saves the session and the user is not required to login each page refresh
  - Node-RED Dashboard security supports only one user
