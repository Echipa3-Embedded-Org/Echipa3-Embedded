Node-RED Dashboard security allows for basic authentication when accessing the UI.

Setup:

Edit the file: ~/.node-red/settings.js

Find the commented line starting with: httpNodeAuth

Uncomment and modify the password hash

To generate a hash for any cleartext password, node-red has a built in command: node-red admin hash-pw

This command does the following:
  - waits for user input (the password written in clear-text)
  - generates a hash in console for the input


After the file was modified, restart the service with: node-red-restart

Notes:
  - The browser saves the session and the user is not required to login each page refresh
  - Node-RED Dashboard security supports only one user


Authentication options:
  - Built in node-Red basic authentication and OAuth (Google, Twitter, etc) implemented but does not offer multi-user capabilities
  - Flow Fuse (node-Red instance hosting, only achieved using DNS routing, little to no documentation about local hosting, lack of permanent free options)
  - Linux Identity Management (shadow passwords, Keystone/Keycloack, IPA, LDAP/RADIUS/TACACS) are useless if node-Red doesn't support it
  - Authentication on Proxy for access (impractical since the hosting server is local anyway with limited access from outside)
  - Authentication against a local database service (with lack of proper documentation could not find the proper node-red store widgets that actually work)
